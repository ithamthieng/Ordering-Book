Ordering Book
=========
This is a limit order book written in Java. 

I was doing interviews with quantitative finance firms so I wanted to code up some automated trading strategies as preparation.

This is written in Java, single-threaded and operates on a standard price-time-priority. It supports add operations, delete operations, as well as data retrieval for market spread/depth.
